METHODOLOGY AND  GUIDE


-------->>>>Most of the code have been explained through comments and so here I will explain the conclusions.<<<<----

1>Face Detection-We have used Haar Cascade classifier here along with  Open CV.This part not only detects the face but also the eyes,nose and the mouth

separately.

2>Collecting Training Data-Here we will collect the training data(Images) of the person to be recognised .


3>Training Classifier--The classifier is trained on the training data to recognise a person.


4>Real Time Face Recognition--A box encloses the persons face and displays the name.
